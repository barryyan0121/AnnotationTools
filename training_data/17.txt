About Me I am a multidisciplinary designer specializing in user interface design and user experience (mostly mobile and web interfaces), which  is where I prefer to focus my career. I graduated from Parsons School of Design, majoring in Design and Technology. I have a great passion for design and a clean, simple but modern aesthetic. I am hardworking, dynamic person who is constantly wanting to learn and grow. I put lots of effort into every project because I want to make sure that everything I produce is something that I would be satisfied and excited about if I am the user.EXPERIENCE
