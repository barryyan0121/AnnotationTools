ABOUT ME Hi there! I'm Erica. I have been learning art 20 years through my life! I like to challenge different form and style of art. I have explored fine art, oil painting, traditional Chinese painting, digital painting, in my whole art career. I have a strong comprehension of traditional artistic skills, composition, anatomy, color theory, perspective, and solid drawing fundamentals! I'm a self-motivator and to sum up my credo is keep learning. SKILLS Adobe Photoshop Adobe Premiere Pro Adobe Flash 8 Adobe After Effect Bilingual (Mandarin, English) Final Cut pro CONTACT DETAILS Number: 575-910-9516 Email: ericaquan.edu@gmail.com Website: https://www.instagram.com/callme_yukin g/ ERICA QUAN CONCEPT ARTIST EXPERIENCES 2014/5 Participated in the production of animated ads, Dakaiyanjie For CCTV5 (China Central Television) Team member 2013/11 Illustration of Yongtao Chen Personal Anthology, Published by Huaxia Publishing Art director 2012/10 One Night Surprise starring by Fan Bingbing, initial release in Aug 9, 2013 Storyboard Assistant ACADEMIC BACKGROUND 2015-2017 Academy of Art Universtiy Major: Visual Development/Visual Effect GPA: 3.68 2013-2015 Communication University of China Major.Animation/Game Design GPA: 3.20 2013-2015 Fine Arts School Affiliated to China Central Academy of Fine Arts Major.Fine Art GPA: 3.43 AWARDS Awarded the Best Creative Award of Top Ten Outstanding Art Youth Competition of China Video short film Mask won the second place in the Little Poplar Film Award of Chinese University (Producer) Serial comics Seal and Erica have earned 20k follower on social media of Weibo
